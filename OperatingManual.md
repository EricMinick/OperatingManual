# An Operating Manual for Eric Minick

### Purpose
It takes time for new colleagues to get used to each-other’s ways of working. I hope this document, and an accompanying conversation can speed that acclimation and make it easier to for us to work together effectively.

### Essential things about me
*	**I’m an introvert who likes people:** I enjoy collaborative work and public speaking, but spending time with people drains my energy. I love a good conference but will always skip the concert.
*	**I believe tech can improve the world:** I always look for how products can improve the lives of its users and better the world. That’s what gets me up in the morning to work.
* **I believe in work-life balance:** Routinely working excessive hours will burn someone out. With that in mind, I try hard to respect others' work hours, encourage teammates to take vacations, etc. I expect the same courtesy in return. On occasion, we need to break these guidelines, but those times should be few and consequential. 
*	**I translate tech-speak to English:** I’m pretty good at translating from highly technical concepts to normal English and back. That helps me move between more technical and less technical groups.

### Good work relationships:
*	**Be respectful and decent**: I get frustrated by coworkers who treat others without respect. Please criticize privately, respect time boundaries, and avoid assigning work to people who don’t report to you.
*	**Challenge my ideas:** Particularly in writing and 1:1 conversation, I like to be told when you think I’m wrong. A discussion on the topic is valuable to find the right path forward. I am a big believer in “Disagree, then commit.”
*	**Humility and courage:** Software teams get things wrong a lot. I enjoy working with people who are comfortable doubting our assumptions and plans while still moving forward. Experiments help. 

### Communication and Collaboration:
*	**I start tricky conversations in writing:** When I am concerned about something or think a big change is needed, I’ll write you first. I can clarify my thoughts best when writing. You will receive an email from me first, with an invitation to talk when you have digested it. This intentionally slows things down to express ideas clearly.
*	**I like “back briefing”:** When given instruction or a new idea is shared, I endeavor to play that back in my own words to validate my understanding. Likewise, I appreciate when teammates validate back to me their understanding of what I said. I find this helps to avoid working on the wrong things. 
*	**I prefer brainstorming in the morning and status in the afternoon:** I’m more energetic in the morning. High energy, thoughtful work, including brainstorming is best for me then. I use the afternoons for status meetings, paperwork, and more social engagements. 
*	**On zoom:** I find being on camera draining. I’ll tend to be on camera for personal or hard conversations and keep my camera off for standard conversations or status meetings. 

### My schedule:
*	**Work hours:** My core hours at 8am-5pm MT which will vary depending on meetings.
* **After hours:**  If you need me outside of those hours, text or call. If the conversation can wait until normal hours, please let it wait.  If I receive Slack messages after hours, I’ll typically read them and respond if it’s urgent. Identifying whether you see it as urgent or not is appreciated! 

### Things I’m working on:
*	**Timeliness to meetings:** I’m often 2-3 minutes late to meetings. That’s a poor use of other folks time, and I’m working to be more prompt.
*	**Remembering teammates non-work situations:** I fall into the “work is for work things” trap and do a fairly poor job of remembering the shape of people’s families including names and ages. I’m working to take better notes on family lives, hobbies, etc.
